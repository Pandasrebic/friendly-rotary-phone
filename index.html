                </h3>

                <p2>The Dutch city of Arnhem is changing its layout to protect itself from the extremes of climate change, such as flooding and heatwaves.
                    <br>
                    Under a 10-year plan, 10% of the city’s asphalt will be replaced by grass and other greenery to help dissipate heat and improve absorption of rainfall. The city aims to absorb 90% of rainwater into the soil rather than it running off into sewers.
                    <br>
                    Arnhem sits 13 metres above sea level and has suffered serious flooding in recent years, while droughts have dried up its parks. Trees will be planted along roads to provide cover from the sun, and sheltered “cooling down” areas, centred around ponds, will be constructed near squares and shopping centres.
                    <br>
                    “We must adapt to the climate change that is taking place now,” says city alderman Cathelijne Bouwkamp. [Source: Dezeen]

                </h3>
                <img src="https://www.readersdigest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/good-news-plastic-alternative-fish-waste.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p2>A 23-year-old British design graduate has invented a biodegradable material made from fish waste that could one day replace plastic in packaging.
                    <br>
                    Lucy Hughes (above) used fish offcuts to develop a strong, flexible and translucent material called MarinaTex, which looks and feels like plastic but can be disposed of as compostable food waste.
                    <br>
                    In the UK alone, around 490,000 tonnes of fish waste is produced by the fish processing industry every year. It is of low commercial value and ends up in landfill or incineration. However, through her research, Hughes found that she could create a substitute for plastic by using red algae to bind proteins from fish skins and scales into translucent sheets.
                    <br>
                    A single Atlantic cod could generate the organic waste needed for 1,400 bags of MarinaTex, she says. “It makes no sense to me that we’re using plastic, an incredibly durable material, for products that may have a life cycle of less than a day.”
                    <br>
                    Hughes won the 2019 international James Dyson award for design engineers. Dyson, an inventor and entrepreneur, says: “MarinaTex solves two problems: the ubiquity of single-use plastic and fish waste. I hope it becomes part of a global answer to the abundance of single-use plastic waste.” [Source: Dezeen/The Guardian]

With the prize money, she can fly her botanist mother to see the miraculous Cobalt Blue Orchids--flowers with the resilience to survive against impossible odds. Her mother has been suffering from depression, and Natalie is positive that the flowers’ magic will inspire her mom to fall in love with life again.
